<h2>This is a React JS App, it's a Music Player which has some local songs and allows you also to log in via Spotify and listen to a preview of your Favorite Songs</h2>
<h4>using CI/CD</h4>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
<br>
<i>
So the app is split in two parts, the first have some songs on local and the second part is connected to Spotify, so using an Asynchronuous spotify API if you have any playlists on your spotify account u will be able to listen to a preview of them on this Music Player, and you can search on Spotify's database for your favorite Songs or Artists.
</i>

<h5>The first Part </h5>
The first part represents all the available Songs with the option of specifying the language, it supports Laptops and Pcs just as it supports tablets and phones


<h5>As for the second part</h5> It shows all your Spotify playlists Asynchronuously and you could listen to a preview through their API, it has also a search box which does return either the Artists or the Tracks you're looking for
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
